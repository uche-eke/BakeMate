### **BakeMate: Easy Ordering for Small Bakeries**

**Project Description**  
BakeMate is an intuitive ordering app designed specifically for small bakeries to streamline order management. Developed with React, this app enables bakeries to track orders from customers easily, simplifying both order placement and inventory tracking. BakeMate is tailored to help small businesses reduce order errors and stay organized, allowing bakeries to focus more on what they do best—baking! This project demonstrates core e-commerce principles like item listing, cart management, and order tracking.

**How to Use**  
Customers can browse through the bakery's offerings, add items to their cart, and review the order summary before submitting. The app includes an “Order History” section for quick reference to past orders, ensuring that repeat customers can re-order their favorites with ease. Once an order is submitted, the bakery receives a notification and can manage orders through an internal dashboard.
